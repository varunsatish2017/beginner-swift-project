# Beginner Swift Project 

# Prework - *PreWork for iOS Development*

Submitted by: **Varun Satishkumar**

**PreWork for iOS Development** is an app that displays my name, university, and career aspiration. There's a button that can change the background color of the screen (using a randomly generated color) and the color of the text displayed (also using a randomly generated color).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite app features:
- Instagram: Refresh the page by scrolling up at the top of the page
- 

My App Idea: WeatherReminder
- 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Nothing major, but when I was trying to make the "change text color" feature, I got an _NSExceptionError_ that caused the app to crash.
